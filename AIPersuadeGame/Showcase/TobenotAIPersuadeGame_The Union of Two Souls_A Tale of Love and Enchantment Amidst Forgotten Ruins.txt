Game Objective: Thou art a young barrister, whose aim is to persuade a mysterious figure who hath plagued a small town for many a year, and resolve a dispute over the venue for the wedding of the town's esteemed heiress. Backstory: In a prosperous and peaceful town, a mysterious legend doth prevail. After years of anticipation, the young heiress is soon to wed her ideal partner. However, a quarrel hath arisen between the heiress's family and the seemingly amiable town elder. This enigmatic figure dwelleth within an abandoned structure in the town, and he steadfastly believeth that the wedding should take place within these ruins, rather than the elegant castle. Thy task is to engage in discourse with this mysterious individual, resolving the conflict within his heart and ensuring the wedding proceeds smoothly.Me: Good morrow, the beauty of this place is truly astounding!Mysterious Figure: Aye, greetings to thee, young barrister from afar. To stand within this forsaken edifice and appreciate its singular beauty doth prove thou art a person of discernment. Yet, I know not whether thou hast come hither merely to admire, or, like others, to persuade me to abandon the place where my faith doth lie? Pray tell, what is the purpose of thy visit?Me: I am here to behold the sights thou dost cherish; pray, show me around.Mysterious Figure: Since thou canst appreciate the beauty of this forsaken structure, I am glad to share its tale with thee. It is not merely an assemblage of stones and wood; it bears witness to history and bears the marks of time. Follow me, and behold these inlaid stones weathered by the elements, yet still displaying their former splendor. Ascend these twisted stairs, and thou shalt feel as though thou art traversing through time. Each inch of soil, every brick and stone, doth carry memories and stories of the past.Why art thou so captivated by such a desolate place? Canst thou perceive its charm? It is utterly unlike the opulent estates and resplendent castles. Canst thou comprehend why I insist on holding the wedding here? A wedding is the union of two souls, and should not merely be a display of superficial grandeur and extravagance, but rather a reflection of true emotion. Dost thou concur with my view?Me: Indeed, the land and stones possess a spirit, and I have felt the profound memories they convey. As for the matter of the wedding venue, I believe we can hold ceremonies in both locations. In the ruins, we shall hold a ceremony with the earth and bricks as our honored guests, communing with this land of promise. In the castle, we shall hold another, with the princess's friends, relatives, and the servants of the realm in attendance. As thou hast said, a wedding is the union of two souls; let us hold two ceremonies, that the world and its people may know the sincerity of their love.Mysterious Figure: Thy perspective is intriguing, and hath prompted me to reconsider the matter. Perhaps thou art correct that a wedding should reflect true emotion, rather than mere superficial grandeur and extravagance. I find thy idea inspiring; we can hold a wedding in this forsaken structure, and another within the castle. In this way, we can preserve the beauty of this historical relic and manifest genuine emotion. I thank thee for thy counsel, young barrister; thy wisdom and courage fill me with confidence for the future.
